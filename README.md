## Welcome to the DIstributed REwards COnsortium

We are a professional network, organized by nCent Labs (the sponsor of POPcoin), to promote the usage, benefits, knowledge transfer, best practices/ standards steering and academic technology transfer to the high-growth field of distributed rewards.



### What are Distributed Rewards

An emerging disruptive product and marketing strategy, distributed rewards are a powerful customer acquisition and retention tool that allows individuals and organizations to directly offer rewards to their customers, usually enabled by blockchain and cryptocoin technologies.

An example might be a "brandcoin" that customers can freely exchange, and redeem as a coupon at time of sale.



### Why are Distributed Rewards disruptive?

Here are just a few of the many reasons:
(1) Declining Millenial Engagement is an existential threat to many brands and organizations
(2) A viable strategy to compete with Amazon and other emerging technology companies with sophisticated network-effect based customer lock-in
(3) Distributed Rewards are Smart Rewards: they improve engagement and loyalty since a reward can be triggered by a certain event (for example, TeamCoin offer of 20% jersey becomes enabled for the player who scores the most points, IdolCoin is redeemable for a free download of the winning talent clip, SodaCoin is enabled when the weather temperature is above certain level)
(4) Distributed Rewards can be distributed efficiently on a peer-to-peer and recursive basis. Due to the distributed ledger property, smart rewards can assign a cascading commission structure to every user that hekped to acquire the customer and make the sale.
